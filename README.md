### About the technologies used

I'm in favor of taking advantage of the resources that are already created, even taking into account the limits it generates in the creative side, so I decided to take advantage of every resource that Bootstrap offers, trying not to include more code to the stylesheet than strictly necessary.

## How the website works

At startup, the site shows the 10 most popular movies according to The Movie Database (TMDb).

To consult a title, type one or more terms related to the title, regardless of the original language, and all related titles will appear, with its poster, English title, title in its original language, genre and overview.

In case the poster, genre or overview is not available, the site will display an image or alternative text.

If there are no results for the search, it will display the message `"Your search has not returned any results"`.
